# De-Lux âœ¨ - From Fancy to Framework

Turn your meticulously crafted masterpieces into bare-bones wireframes with one click! For those special meetings where everyone ignores your "this isn't final" disclaimer and instead spends 20 minutes debating that shade of blue you randomly picked.

## âœ¨ What's Cool About It?

- **One-Click Wonder**: Zap! Your detailed design becomes a clean wireframe faster than you can say "low-fidelity"
- **Smart Cookie Detection**: De-Lux is pretty clever about handling different elements:
  - Text stays where it should (no wandering words here!)
  - Icons get a minimalist makeover
  - Containers keep their structure
  - Navigation elements don't lose their way
- **Consistent Vibes**:
  - Clean, monochrome magic
  - Borders that behave
  - Spacing that makes sense
  - Smart fill handling (because transparency is important!)
- **Keeps the Good Stuff**:
  - Your layout stays pixel-perfect
  - Text knows how to resize itself (smart text is smart)
  - Important structures stick around

## ðŸŽ® How to Use

1. Pick the frame you want to de-luxe
