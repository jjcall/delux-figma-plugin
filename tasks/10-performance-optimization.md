# Task 10: Performance Optimization

## Description
Optimize the plugin's performance to handle complex designs and large artboards efficiently, ensuring a smooth user experience even with demanding conversion tasks.

## Deliverables
- Implement performance profiling and benchmarking
- Optimize element traversal and transformation algorithms
- Add intelligent batching for processing large node trees
- Optimize memory usage during conversion process
- Implement cancellation capability for long-running operations
- Add detailed progress reporting for complex conversions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Plugin can handle complex designs with 100+ elements without crashing
- Conversion time scales reasonably with design complexity
- Memory usage remains within acceptable limits for large designs
- Users can cancel long-running operations
- Progress reporting provides accurate estimates during conversion
- Performance benchmarks show improvement over unoptimized version

## Estimated Effort
3-4 days

## Dependencies
- Task 3: Basic Element Transformation
- Task 6: Advanced Element Recognition
- Task 7: Batch Processing
