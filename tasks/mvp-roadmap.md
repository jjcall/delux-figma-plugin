# Wireframe Converter Plugin - MVP Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for the Wireframe Converter plugin, breaking down the development into clear phases with increasing functionality.

## Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP focuses on delivering the core functionality to allow a basic but usable wireframe conversion experience.

**Tasks included:**
- Task 1: Setup Plugin Structure
- Task 2: Basic Frame Selection and Duplication
- Task 3: Basic Element Transformation (MVP)
- Task 4: Basic Style Conversion
- Task 5: Basic UI Improvements

**Expected Deliverable:**
A working Figma plugin that can convert a single selected frame into a wireframe version by transforming basic elements (text, images, rectangles) and applying grayscale styling. The user interface will be simple but functional.

**Timeline:** 7-10 days

## Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality
This phase builds upon the MVP to add more sophisticated element recognition and batch processing capabilities.

**Tasks included:**
- Task 6: Advanced Element Recognition
- Task 7: Batch Processing
- Task 8: Customization Options

**Expected Deliverable:**
An enhanced plugin that can recognize and transform complex UI elements, process multiple frames simultaneously, and offer users customization options for the wireframe output style.

**Timeline:** 8-10 days after Phase 1

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
The final phase adds annotation capabilities and performance optimizations to handle complex designs efficiently.

**Tasks included:**
- Task 9: Annotation Tools
- Task 10: Performance Optimization

**Expected Deliverable:**
A fully-featured wireframe conversion plugin with annotation tools and optimized performance for handling complex designs and large artboards.

**Timeline:** 6-8 days after Phase 2

## Testing and Validation
Each phase should include rigorous testing with real-world Figma designs of varying complexity.

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
After the initial release, consider:
- Component library integration
- Advanced customization presets
- Interactive wireframe generation
- Export options for documentation
- User-defined transformation rules
