# Product Requirements Document: Wireframe Converter

## Executive Summary
The Wireframe Converter is a Figma plugin that transforms high-fidelity designs into simplified wireframes with a single click. Unlike the traditional design workflow where wireframes evolve into detailed mockups, this plugin reverses the process - allowing designers to "dumb down" their polished designs for more effective communication. By removing visual distractions, the plugin helps teams focus conversations on structure and functionality rather than aesthetic details.

## Problem Statement
When presenting high-fidelity designs to stakeholders, conversations often derail into discussions about colors, typography, and visual elements rather than core functionality and user flows. Designers need a quick way to simplify their detailed mockups for presentations and feedback sessions that focus on structural decisions.

## User Personas

### Primary: UX/UI Designers
- **Needs**: Tools to facilitate better design discussions, methods to present work at varying fidelity levels
- **Pain Points**: Stakeholders fixating on visual details too early, time spent manually creating wireframes
- **Goals**: Get meaningful feedback on structure and functionality, streamline the design review process

### Secondary: Product Managers & Stakeholders
- **Needs**: Understanding design concepts without being distracted by visual details
- **Pain Points**: Difficulty focusing on functionality when viewing polished designs
- **Goals**: Make informed decisions about product functionality and structure

## Goals and Objectives
1. Enable one-click conversion from high-fidelity designs to wireframes
2. Facilitate more productive conversations about layout and functionality
3. Save designers time in preparing presentation materials
4. Improve design feedback quality by focusing attention on structure over style
5. Preserve layout integrity while simplifying visual elements

## Features and Requirements

### Core Features

#### 1. Frame Selection and Conversion
- Allow selection of any frame, artboard, or group of elements
- Generate wireframe version while preserving original
- Support batch processing of multiple frames

#### 2. Element Recognition and Transformation
- **Text Elements**: Convert to gray bars representing text blocks with preserved width
- **Images**: Replace with placeholder boxes containing X marks or image icons
- **Buttons**: Transform into simple rectangular outlines with preserved text
- **Input Fields**: Convert to empty rectangles with subtle labels
- **Navigation Elements**: Simplify to basic line representations
- **Icons**: Replace with simplified geometric shapes based on icon type
- **Complex Components**: Identify and simplify common UI patterns (cards, tabs, etc.)

#### 3. Style Conversion
- Replace color palette with grayscale or blueprint scheme
- Simplify typography to basic sans-serif with limited weight variations
- Remove shadows, gradients, and decorative effects
- Standardize border treatments and radii
- Preserve critical visual hierarchy using different gray values

#### 4. Customization Options
- Wireframe style presets (classic, blueprint, sketchy, etc.)
- Fidelity level slider (minimal to moderately detailed)
- Element-specific conversion settings
- Text representation options (lorem ipsum, original text, or bars)
- Output frame positioning options

### Secondary Features

#### 1. Organization and Workflow
- Generate new frame with _Wireframe appended to name
- Maintain layer naming and structure for clarity
- Option to group original and wireframe for easy comparison

#### 2. Annotation Tools
- Auto-generate numbered annotations for key elements
- Add wireframe-specific comments or notes
- Export annotation key for documentation

## User Flow
1. Designer selects frame(s) in Figma document
2. Designer opens Wireframe Converter plugin
3. Plugin displays conversion options and settings
4. Designer adjusts settings if needed and clicks "Convert to Wireframe"
5. Plugin processes selection and creates wireframe version
6. Designer reviews result and makes any manual adjustments
7. Designer shares wireframe version for feedback

## Technical Requirements

### Figma API Integration
- Traverse and analyze node tree to identify element types
- Access and modify style properties (fill, stroke, effects)
- Create new frames while preserving layout structure
- Manage layer organization and naming

### Processing Logic
- Pattern recognition algorithms for common UI elements
- Style mapping from high-fidelity to wireframe treatments
- Layout preservation ensuring proper spacing and alignment
- Component instance handling

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize for processing large and complex designs
- Implement progress indicators for batch operations
- Handle varied content types efficiently

## UI/UX Design

### Plugin Interface
- Clean, minimal interface consistent with Figma's design language
- Main panel with clear conversion controls and preview
- Collapsible settings sections for advanced options
- Visual feedback showing conversion process
- Before/after preview option

## Constraints and Limitations
- Cannot perfectly identify custom or highly specialized UI elements
- May require manual adjustments for complex or unusual layouts
- Not intended to convert illustrations or highly visual designs completely
- Limited ability to interpret design intent beyond visual representation
