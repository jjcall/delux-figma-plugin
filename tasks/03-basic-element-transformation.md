# Task 3: Basic Element Transformation (MVP)

## Description
Implement the core wireframing functionality to transform the most common element types (text, images, and rectangles) into simplified wireframe representations.

## Deliverables
- Develop algorithms to identify basic element types:
  - Text elements
  - Image elements
  - Rectangle/shape elements
- Transform text elements into gray bars with preserved width and position
- Transform images into placeholder boxes with X marks
- Transform colored rectangles/shapes into grayscale outlines
- Apply grayscale conversion to all elements

## Acceptance Criteria
- Plugin successfully identifies and transforms basic element types
- Text elements are replaced with appropriate gray bars
- Images are replaced with standard placeholder boxes
- Colors are converted to grayscale
- Layout and positioning remain intact after transformation
- The transformation runs in a reasonable time (< 5 seconds for simple frames)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days
