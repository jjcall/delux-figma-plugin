# De-Lux ✨ - From Fancy to Framework

Turn your polished UI designs into sleek wireframes with a sprinkle of magic! De-Lux helps designers strip away the fancy and focus on what matters - structure and flow. It's like a time machine for your designs, taking them back to their essence.

## ✨ What's Cool About It?

- **One-Click Wonder**: Zap! Your detailed design becomes a clean wireframe faster than you can say "low-fidelity"
- **Smart Cookie Detection**: Our plugin is pretty clever about handling different elements:
  - Text stays where it should (no wandering words here!)
  - Icons get a minimalist makeover
  - Containers keep their cool structure
  - Navigation elements don't lose their way
- **Consistent Vibes**:
  - Clean, monochrome magic
  - Borders that behave
  - Spacing that makes sense
  - Smart fill handling (because transparency is important!)
- **Keeps the Good Stuff**:
  - Your layout stays pixel-perfect
  - Text knows how to resize itself (smart text is smart)
  - Important structures stick around
  - Respects the transparency game
